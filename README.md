# NCAA Football 14 Player Discipline Program

This program is designed to simulate academic and team rules violations by players in NCAA Football 14. The program will randomly determine if an infraction occurred. If so, it will decide on a player who committed the infraction (if the player chosen does not exist, the user can choose to reroll a different player) and check whether they broke team, academic, or NCAA rules and how long they are suspended for.
